However, specifying their parameters (such as models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc.,) and debugging them remains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework. AUTOGEN STUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled workflows. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop UI for agent workflow specification, interactive evaluation and debugging of workflows, and a gallery of reusable agent components. We highlight four design principles for no-code multi-agent developer tools and contribute an open-source implementation.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nWhen combined with the ability to act (e.g., using tools), Generative AI models function as agents, enabling complex problem-solving capabilities. Importantly, recent research has shown that transitioning from prescribed (fixed) agent pipelines to a multi-agent setup with autonomous capabilities can result in desirable behaviors such as improved factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023), as well as divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023). These observations have driven the development of application frameworks such as AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), CAMEL (Li et al., 2024), and TaskWeaver (Qiao et al., 2023), which simplify the process of crafting multi-agent applications expressed as Python code. However, while multi-agent applications advance our capacity to solve complex problems, they also introduce new challenges. For example, developers must now configure a large number of parameters for these systems including defining agents (e.g., the model to use, prompts, tools or skills available to the agent, number of action steps an agent can take, task termination conditions etc.), communication and orchestration mechanisms - i.e., the order or sequence in which agents act as they collaborate on a task. Additionally, developers need to debug and make sense of complex agent interactions to extract signals for system improvement. All of these factors can create significant barriers to entry and make the multi-agent design process tedious and error-prone. To address these challenges, we have developed AUTOGEN STUDIO, a tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating MULTI-AGENT workflows. Our contributions are highlighted as follows:\n\n- AUTOGEN STUDIO - a developer-focused tool (UI and backend Web and Python API) for declaratively specifying and debugging (human-in-the-loop and non-interactive) MULTI-AGENT workflows.

They also do not provide tools or metrics for agent debugging and evaluation. Additionally, they lack structured reusable templates to bootstrap or accelerate the agent workflow creation process.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2022, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5806e5d-b065-48ef-baa7-ee4cd58fc384": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5806e5d-b065-48ef-baa7-ee4cd58fc384", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0368211-95ed-4454-b06d-62d956ba3572", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "hash": "072b79a56429fbdf199d3cabdc1afcf94392c677a0a3209d095ce27ef02ddbde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Design Goals\n\nAUTOGEN STUDIO is designed to enhance the MULTI-AGENT developer experience by focusing on three core objectives:\n\n- Rapid Prototyping: Provide a playground where developers can quickly specify agent configurations and compose these agents into effective multi-agent workflows.\n- Developer Tooling: Offer tools designed to help developers understand and debug agent behaviors, facilitating the improvement of multi-agent systems.\n- Reusable Templates: Present a gallery of reusable, shareable templates to bootstrap agent workflow creation. This approach aims to establish shared standards and best practices for MULTI-AGENT system development, promoting wider adoption and implementation of MULTI-AGENT solutions.\n\n# System Design\n\nAUTOGEN STUDIO is implemented across two high-level components: a frontend user interface (UI) and a backend API (web, python and command line). It can be installed via the PyPI package manager (listing 1).\n\npip install autogenstudio\nautogenstudio ui --port 8081\n\nlisting 1: AUTOGEN STUDIO can be installed from PyPI (pip) and the UI launched from the command line.\n\n# User Interface\n\nThe frontend web interface in AUTOGEN STUDIO is built using React and implements three main views that support several key functionalities. The build view enables users to author (define-and-compose) multi-agent workflows. The playground view allows for interactive task execution and workflow debugging, with options to export and deploy. The gallery view facilitates the reuse and sharing of agent artifact templates.\n\n# Building Workflows\n\nThe build view in the UI (see Figure 1) offers a define-and-compose experience, allowing developers to declaratively define low-level components and iteratively compose them into a workflow. For instance, users can define configurations for models, skills/tools (represented as Python functions addressing specific tasks), or memory stores (e.g., documents organized in a vector database). Each entity is saved in a database for use across interface interactions. Subsequently, they can define an agent, attaching models, skills, and memory to it. Several agent default templates are provided following AUTOGEN abstractions - a UserProxy agent (has a code execution tool by default), an AssistantAgent (has a generative AI model default), and a GroupChat agent (an abstraction container for defining a list of agents, and how they interact). Finally, workflows can be defined, with existing agents attached to these workflows. The default workflow patterns supported are autonomous chat (agents exchange messages and actions across conversation turns until a termination condition is met) and sequential chat (a sequence of agents defined, each agent processes its input in order and passes on a summary of their output to the next agent). The workflow composition process is further enhanced by supporting a drag-and-drop interaction e.g., skills/models can be dragged to agents and agents into workflows.\n\n# Testing and Debugging Workflows\n\nWorkflows can be tested in-situ in the build view, or more systematically explored within the playground view. The playground view allows users to create sessions, attach workflows to the session, and run tasks (single shot or multi-turn). Sessions can be shared (to illustrate workflow performance) and multiple sessions can be compared. AUTOGEN STUDIO provides two features to support debugging. First, it provides an observe view where as tasks progress, messages and actions performed by agents are streamed to the interface, and all generated artifacts are displayed (e.g., files such as images, code, documents etc). Second a post-hoc profiler view is provided where a set of metrics are visualized for each task addressed by a workflow.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3762, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b6d38de-909c-44a7-8e2f-46a6186939bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b6d38de-909c-44a7-8e2f-46a6186939bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "650e97f4-59fb-42fe-b835-e56bf9f12d92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "hash": "b1528227cb00353f4903ed6700e88a5ba7a9f209922c92cb92783ba9f8be21aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Backend API\n\n# Frontend Web UI\n\n# API B\n\nautogenstudio.web.app\n\nAutoGen Studio\n\n# Book generation\n\n# Recent sessions\n\nObserve Agents\n\nWeb API\n\nAUTOGEN\n\ncreate a childrens pdf book with 4 pages, each describing the weather in seattle.

Since its release on GitHub (5 months), the AUTOGEN STUDIO package has been installed over 200K times and has been iteratively improved based on feedback from usage (> 135 GitHub issues). Issues highlighted several user pain points that were subsequently addressed including: (a) challenges in defining, persisting, and reusing components, resolved by implementing a database layer; (b) difficulties in authoring components, resolved by supporting automated tool generation from descriptions and integrating an IDE for editing tools; (c) frustrations caused by components failing during end-to-end tests, addressed by incorporating a test button for components (e.g., models) and workflows in the build view.\n\nFigure 3 displays a plot of all AUTOGEN STUDIO issues. Each point represents an issue, based on an embedding of its text (title + body) using OpenAI\u2019s text-embedding-3-large model. The embeddings were reduced to two dimensions using UMAP, clustered with K-Means (k = 8), and cluster labels generated using GPT-4 (grounded on 10 samples from its centroid).\n\nFinally, in Appendix A, we demonstrate how AUTOGEN STUDIO can effectively be used to support an engineer persona in rapidly prototyping, testing, and iteratively debugging a MULTI-AGENT workflow, and deploying it as an API endpoint to address a concrete task (generating books).\n\n# 6 Emerging Design Patterns and Research Directions\n\n# 6.1 Define-and-Compose Workflows\n\nAllow users to author workflows by defining components and composing them (via drag-and-drop actions) into multi-agent workflows. A multi-agent system can have a wide array of parameters to configure. We have found that selecting the right visual presentation of the workflow to help users understand what parameters to configure (discovery), and how to configure them. Specifically, we have found that a define-and-compose workflow, where entities are first defined and persisted independently, and then composed ultimately into multi-agent workflows, provides a good developer experience. This includes providing tools to support authoring entities e.g., the ability to define and test models, an IDE for generating/editing tools (code), and a canvas-based visual layout of workflows with drag-and-drop interaction for associating entities in the workflow.\n\n# 6.2 Debugging and Sensemaking Tools\n\nProvide robust tools to help users debug, interpret, and rationalize the behavior and outputs of multi-agent systems. Multi-agent workflows can be brittle and fail for multiple reasons, ranging from improperly configured models to poor instructions for agents, improper tool configuration for agents or termination conditions.

This stage requires seamless export and deployment of multi-agent workflows to various platforms and environments.\n\n# 6.4 Collaboration and Sharing\n\nFacilitate user collaboration on multi-agent workflow development and allow easy sharing of creations within the community.\n\nCollaboration and sharing are key to accelerating innovation and improving multi-agent systems. By enabling users to collaborate on workflow development, share their creations, and build upon each other\u2019s work, a more dynamic and innovative development environment can be cultivated. Tools and features that support real-time collaboration, version control, and seamless sharing of workflows and components are essential to foster a community-driven approach. Additionally, offering a repository or gallery where users can publish and share their workflows, skills, and agents promotes communal learning and innovation.\n\n# 8 Conclusion\n\nThis paper introduced AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows. Key features include a drag-and-drop interface for agent workflow composition, interactive debugging capabilities, and a gallery of reusable agent components. Through widespread adoption, we identified emerging design patterns for multi-agent developer tooling - a define and compose approach to authoring workflows, debugging tools to make sense of agent behaviors, tools to enable deployment and collaborative sharing features. AUTOGEN STUDIO lowers the barrier to entry for multi-agent application development, potentially accelerating innovation in the field. Finally, we outline future research directions including developing offline evaluation tools, ablation studies to quantify the impact of MULTI-AGENT systems design decisions and methods for optimizing multi-agent systems.\n\n# 9 Ethics Statement\n\nAUTOGEN STUDIO is designed to provide a no-code environment for rapidly prototyping and testing multi-agent workflows. Our goal is to responsibly advance research and practice in solving problems with multiple agents and to develop tools that contribute to human well-being. Along with AUTOGEN, AUTOGEN STUDIO is committed to implementing features that promote safe and reliable outcomes. For example, AUTOGEN STUDIO offers profiling tools to make sense of agent actions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3086, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ce338d7-07f9-48ca-a8fe-5edddbfc5072": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ce338d7-07f9-48ca-a8fe-5edddbfc5072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "712a9f80-002a-49e6-bab3-2227bd278971", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}, "hash": "7d21d57a2c5785340eb6ce1e5957da386eafc1b8b121643f8c06cd70659914ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "and safeguards, such as support for Docker envi- environments for code execution.

As part of his tasks, he is required to create an application that can generate a variety of short books. The initial version should focus on generating children\u2019s books (age 5 -8 years old) based on a given query (e.g., create a book for kids on how the sun works) with the expectation of being generalized to support other generic tasks. Jack has heard about a MULTI-AGENT approach to building systems that can address a variety of tasks through autonomous collaboration between agents.\n\nTo explore this approach, he begins by perusing the AUTOGEN STUDIO documentation, installs it, launches the UI, and performs the following steps:\n\n# A.1 Step 1: Define and Compose a Workflow\n\nJack starts with the Build view, where he reviews the default skills that come with AUTOGEN STUDIO. He sees that there are two relevant skills: generate_pdf and generate_images. He verifies that he has the appropriate API keys for the generate_image skill. Next, he creates a GPT3.5 model and adds an API key.\n\nFollowing best practices, Jack knows that the basic agent team with AUTOGEN consists of a UserProxyAgent that can execute code and an AssistantAgent that can solve tasks as well as write code or call available tools/skills. He creates both of these agents; for his AssistantAgent, he ensures that he attaches the GPT4 model he created previously and also attaches both skills. Jack moves on to the workflow tab and creates a new autonomous chat workflow where he specifies the UserProxyAgent as the initiator and his AssistantAgent as the receiver.\n\n# A.2 Step 2: Test and Iterate\n\nWithin the workflow tab, Jack tests the workflow immediately and quickly observes a few issues. Using the profiler tool and visualization of messages exchanged by the agents, he notices that there seem to be quality issues with the content of the book - namely, the AssistantAgent seems to generate very short messages and hence the book pages contain only 2 sentences per page whereas the requirements state that the kids are slightly older and can read much longer text.\n\nTo remedy these issues, Jack takes two actions. First, he attempts to extend the base instructions.\n\n# A.3 Step 3: Export and Share\n\nAt this point, Jack has two final tasks: he wants to share his work with colleagues for feedback and then provide an API they can prototype with. AUTOGEN STUDIO makes sharing easy; First, Jack can simply export and share a link to successful sessions. Second, he can also download his workflow and share it with colleagues, saving it in a version control system like Git. Third, he can spin up an API endpoint where the agents can respond to task requests using CLI commands autogenstudio serve \u2013port 8000. He can also spin up a docker container using the AUTOGEN STUDIO serve command and scale it on any platform of his choice (Azure, AWS, GCP, Hugging Face).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2952, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5d8f9898-f552-44be-9223-c44b0a0b9b18": {"node_ids": ["3f72349e-ad4a-4102-8291-65a658057739"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "5401c385-95ab-475f-a9ac-f9346afff77f": {"node_ids": ["12667103-ac09-4ec2-9efb-0df5badb6d27"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "c0368211-95ed-4454-b06d-62d956ba3572": {"node_ids": ["a5806e5d-b065-48ef-baa7-ee4cd58fc384"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "650e97f4-59fb-42fe-b835-e56bf9f12d92": {"node_ids": ["1b6d38de-909c-44a7-8e2f-46a6186939bb"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "3e2b4bde-f670-4a78-a817-49690cba39d5": {"node_ids": ["81369f89-0a51-4918-b32d-4ec7e2ef2757"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "54bf679a-e78f-4036-8434-ad29030b5fe3": {"node_ids": ["f048185c-b664-436c-9a32-0a067d23c9e4"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "712a9f80-002a-49e6-bab3-2227bd278971": {"node_ids": ["9ce338d7-07f9-48ca-a8fe-5edddbfc5072"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}, "cc3826ff-6f04-4281-b965-3427329039fd": {"node_ids": ["1a8a809f-e5da-4623-8a5e-9390e708d7e9"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\llamaindex_tuts\\pdf\\ag-studio.pdf", "file_name": "ag-studio.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3112466, "creation_date": "2025-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-25"}}}}
